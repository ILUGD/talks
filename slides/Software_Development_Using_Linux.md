### Notes on the talk	"Software development on Linux" 
 **Taken by Anuvrat Parashar** 

### Why on Linux ?
 
1. Setting up development environment
2. Job 
3. Thinking
4. Linux is where you become productive
5. Write better code and software
    
### Software Development needs 
 
1. git is a popular VCS using GitHub and Bitbucket as their center
2. A development environment ( even virtual )
3. Somewhere to run the code - Terminal
4. Debuggers and compilers 
5. Text editors 
6. A collaborative and dependent **team** whom you work with.

### Summing up

1. Linux systems are open. 
2. Don't use IDE. GUI are meant for end-user.
3. Understand how things work. That's a programmer's job to know.  

### Thank you.
